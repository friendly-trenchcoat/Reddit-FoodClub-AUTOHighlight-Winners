# Reddit-FoodClub-AUTOHighlight-Winners
No input necessary! 

Each bet table will AUTOMATICALLY have winning bets highlighted, and total winnings added up and displayed at top of comment. Now works for *every day!* (piggybacks off of diceroll123's stuff and daqtools)

The winners will be displayed in the main post if they have been decided.
